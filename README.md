Weatheria - rain or shine, we've got you covered!

Using WeatherAPI's weather data I set out to improve on my JavaScript skills and embark on working with APIs for the very first time. Thanks to this experience, I can confidently move towards bigger projects and new frameworks. I also took the time to implement the weather-icon library in order to override the existing icons - they weren't up to my standards.
